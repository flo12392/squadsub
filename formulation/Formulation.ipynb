    "Here, The objective function $(1)$ maximizes the sum of the skills of players that are on the pitch each time window. Constraint $(2)$ ensures that every player occupies at most one position during every time window, i.e. they are either on the pitch or they are a substitute. Constraint $(3)$ states that every position should be filled by exactly one player during every time window. Furthermore, Constraint $(4)$ prohibits players from changing positions on the pitch in subsequent time windows; a player can only play on another position if he is substituted in between. Constraints $(5)$ and $(6)$ aim to balance the amount of times each player is substituted. Constraint $(7)$ ensures that there is a minimum amount of time windows between subsequent substitutions of a single player. Lastly, Constraint $(8)$ states that the $x$-variables can only take binary values.\n"
